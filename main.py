    Categorize a skin lesion as benign or malignant utilizing interleaving Thought, Action, and Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be one of three types:

(1) retrieve[patient], which collects patient data

(2) process[data], which provides the patient data to your internal neural network and allows you to determine whether or not the patient is a progressor or a non-progressor

(3) finish[answer], which returns the answer and diagnoses the patient. The action "finish[benign]" will categorize a given skin lesion as benign; while the action "finish[malignant]" will diagnose a given skin lesion as malignant.

Here are some examples.
